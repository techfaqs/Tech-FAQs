# Block chain

A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records
(called blocks) which are linked and secured using cryptography

Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,
a timestamp and transaction data.
By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data.

A blockchain can serve as
"__an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between
two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.__"
