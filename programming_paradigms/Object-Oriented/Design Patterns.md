# Design Patterns

Types:
- 5 Creational Patterns
- 7 Structural Patterns
- 11 Behavioral Patterns

### 5 Creational Pattern

- Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist
- Abstract Factory - A class requests the objects it requires from a factory object instead of creating the objects directly
- Factory Method - Centralize creation of an object of a specific type choosing one of several implementations
- Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
- Dependency Injection - A class accepts the objects it requires from an injector instead of creating the objects directly

### 7 Structural Patterns

- Adaptor - Match interfaces of different classes
- Bridge - Separates an object's interface from its implementation
- Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- Fascade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- Proxy - An object representing another object
- Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

### 11 Behavioral Patterns

- Chain of responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
- Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
- Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
- Momento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
- Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- Stratergy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- Templete - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
