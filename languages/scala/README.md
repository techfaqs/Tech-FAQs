# SCALA

Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language designed to express
 common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way.
 It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages.

 Features:
- Scala is a pure __object-oriented language__ in the sense that every value
  is an object. 
- Scala is a __functional language__ in the sense that every function is a
  value. 
- Scala enforces __statically__ that abstractions are used in a safe and
  coherent manner. 

Scala is designed to interoperate well with the popular Java Runtime
Environment (JRE).
