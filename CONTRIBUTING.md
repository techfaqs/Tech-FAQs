Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/animenon/Tech-FAQs/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits and add the Issue Number (if your commit is for an Issue). One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

### Want to add a new Tech-FAQ?

* Create a new folder for your technology
* Use [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) files to add the information you think is relevant (eg commands, usefull hints...)
  * maybe structure the information in different, meaningful files

### Want to contribute to an already existing Tech-FAQ?

* Create a new file or extend an existing one in the regarding technology-folder
* Use [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/)  to add the information you think is relevant (eg commands, useful hints...)
* Add useful link you found for a technology/topic (eg Cheatsheets, commands ..) by creating a file of the format <technology>.md.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
