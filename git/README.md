# GIT

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

 Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. 



### Getting a GIT repo

You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:

1.   You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or

2.   You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.
