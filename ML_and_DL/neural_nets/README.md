# Neural Nets

Neural networks are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
It is a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons.

The neural network method of solving problems is called ***deep learning***. 
The concept of a neural network appears to have first been proposed by *Alan Turing* in his 1948 paper *Intelligent Machinery*
 in which he called them " *B-type unorganised machines* ".

The utility of artificial neural network models lies in the fact that they can be used to infer a function from observations and also to use it.
 Unsupervised neural networks can also be used to learn representations of the input that capture the salient characteristics of the input distribution.

### Applications

Neural networks can be used in different fields. Few examples -

- Function approximation, or regression analysis, including time series prediction and modeling.
- Classification, including pattern and sequence recognition, novelty detection and sequential decision making.
- Data processing, including filtering, clustering, blind signal separation and compression.

Most applications of deep learning use “convolutional” neural networks, in which the nodes of each layer are clustered, the clusters overlap, and each cluster feeds data to multiple nodes of the next layer.
