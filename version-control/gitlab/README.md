# GitLab

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) is a social coding website based on the Git Version Control system. It is a remote host to store your Git repositories for collaborative team software development. It is like a machine tool, GitLab helps you build more software.

How can you distribute the most recent copy of your app with your software development team? How can you write code and collaborate with other software developers on the same codebase or project at the same time without dependencies and version conflict? 
GitLab solves these problems.

Using GitLab allows developers from all over the world to host and collaborate on their projects in real time. This allows the teams to merge changes easily using the trunk based development model. 

It allows users to host remote repositories to facilitate collaborative software development.
A local repository on your PC can be uploaded to GitLab so that other members of your software team can get the latest copy of your project. Git Software is for local version control on a PC.  Your local repository can be uploaded to GitLab. Since it works directly with Git, you need a solid understanding of Git to use GitLab.  

Each social coding website has it own unique and useful features as well as different pricing structure. But a unique feature of GitLab is the self-hosted server option. Instead of hosting your repository at a remote website, you can actually host an open-source version of the GitLab server privately. 

To get the most use of GitLab, you have to know [basic GIT commands](../git/README.md) first.
