# Bitbucket

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) is a social coding website using the Git Version Control system. Bitbucket debuted in 2011. 

How can you distribute the most recent copy of your app with your software development team?
How can you write code and collaborate with other software developers  on the same codebase or project at the same time without conflict in dependencies or version? 
Bitbucket solves these problems.

Bitbucket allows users to host remote repositories to facilitate collaborative software development. Git Software is for local version control on a PC.  Your local repository can be uploaded to Bitbucket so that other members of your software team can get the latest copy of your repository. Since Bitbucket works directly with Git, you need a solid understanding of Git to use Bitbucket.  

Using Bitbucket allows developers from all over the world to host and collaborate on their projects in real time. This allows the teams to merge changes easily using the trunk based development model.
